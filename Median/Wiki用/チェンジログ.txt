Amazon 
- Dragonforce: range synergy now from Ghost Arrow; now gains +1 target per 2 levels to balance it against Barrage and Phalanx.

Assassin 
- Perfect Being: bonus +5% at all levels. 
- Phase Bomb: resist pierce locked at -15%, enough to remove immunities but not enough to break uberquest shield auras. 
- Singularity: mana cost now 470. 
Barbarian 
- Eagle Stance: nerf reverted: heal bonus again based on soft points because I forgot people do not want to put more than 1 point into an active defensive skill unless it makes you invincible, and even then. This one only makes you half invincible.

Assassin 
- Singularity: corrected mana cost.

1.99d -> 1.A9 beta 3 
**Characters 
- Base block modifier down to 0 for paladins, -1 for everyone else, -2 for sorcs. 
- Reduced mana per energy point by -1 (now you gain +2, +4 or +6) to reduce the chance of overflow with heavy investment. 
- Energy Factor power increased, but now tapers off at very high energy investments to prevent damage overflow. 
- The minion resistance cap is now +75%, up from 50% (and not 25%, liars). 
- Slightly reduced mana gain per energy point of some mana-intensive characters to avoid mana overflow. 
- All enemy-affecting resist pierce skills (except the assassin uberskill Phase Bomb) have been removed, leaving only item-based sources of -% resist (including Shadowfiends). This is because due to a bug in D2, they worked at full strength against immunities based on shield auras, making a lot of uberquests trivial to beat. Sorry, people. 

- Fixed most passive poison descriptions. 
- Unnerfed leech. 

***アマゾン
- Death Ray: fixed too-long formula causing erroneously low damage. 
- Dragonstrike replaces Wraith Arrow: fires a slow moving dragon that shoots spines at nearby enemies.

- Moon Warrior: increased enhanced damage bonus from 15% to 20% per level. 
- Pact of Blood: duration now goes up with hard points. 

- Dragonforce: damage 1/2; starts at 2 targets; fixed incorrect excessive target description. 

- Dragonforce: damage now 1/4. 

***Assassin 
- Doom: reduced synergy from 20% to 15%. 
- Perfect Being: now based on hard points, but you get run speed from soft points. 
- Rocket Blade replaces Maelstrom: fires a zigzagging explosive knife. 
- Scorpion Blade: now gains +1 blade per 10 Broadside levels; synergy moved to Rocket Blade. 
- Singularity: mana cost frozen at 780. 
- Way of the Spider: poison length now increases by 0.2 seconds per level. 



***バーバリアン
- Eagle Stance: heal rate now based on hard points, and there is now a slight damage penalty. 
- Kraken Stance: added max level synergy from all other stances. 
- Lion Stance: corrected display showing excessive damage; reduced ED% component; removed max level synergy but increased magic damage per level. 
- Predator replaces Berserk Fury: similar effect, but instead of hit recovery speed it offers life steal. 
- Runemaster: reduced by half. 
- Screaming Eagle replaces Eagle Dive: similar effect, but instead of resist pierce it reduces damage and attack speed. 
- Shower of Rocks: now instead of the (bugged) physical resist pierce, it reduces enemy damage. This is because the proposed -% attack rating change was useless because you didn't bother doing the math or you did and concluded that -50% attack rating is slightly inferior to x2 defense so it's weak and gimped. Please abandon your melee barb. I want you to make a bombsin. 
- Snake Stance: slowing effect is now a self-synergy. 
- Spirit Guide: now also adds +40% total defense, +15% per hard point. 

- Screaming Eagle: fixed description. 
- Shower of Rocks: changed effect to -% enemy attack rating to prevent reaching 100% in the right party/with the right oskills. 

Barbarian 
- Kraken Stance: removed max level synergy because people don't get it, yay. 
- Spirit Guide: description is now correct. 

**ドルイド
- Poison Flash: coverage +1. 


***ネクロマンサー
- Buckshot: QUAD RANGE. 
- Deathstrike: doubled flat damage component, which isn't bugged. 
- Famine: reduced ED% to prevent damage overflow. 
- Fireheart Totem: to reduce lag, rate of fire divided by 4 but damage multipled by 4. 
- Necromantic Trance: added sound effect. 
- Summon Rampagor: poison damage now increases with character level, up to 5-10x higher than before! 
- Summon Void Archon: aura no longer reduces enemy resistance, but now reduces damage by 25%. 

- Soulshatter: nerf undone, but now properly has ND (2 frames). 

- Soulshatter: removed ND again because zomg any skill with ND is useless, even if it has a ND of *2* and it was bugged to have no ND in the first place so it's like an omnidirectional Buckshot which means it is very overpowered but whatever, I don't care. 

***パラディン 
- Edict of Forbiddance replaces Retribute: periodically deals weapon damage in an area. 
***ソーサレス
- Fixes an issue where some lightning skills gained an incorrect bonus from energy factor.

- Hive: synergy increased from 8% to 10%. 
- Nova Charge: synergy increased from 4% to 6%.

***その他

- Reduced stat% affixes on jewels from 3-6% to 1-2%. 
- Added oskill Ancients' Hand, Tantrum, Gorefest and Clobber to appropriate magic, rare and crafted items. 
Notice on existing affixes 
Due to a rescaling of the corresponding number ranges, existing items with +% chance to block will have their chance go down by 3%, items with +max minions by 5 and items with +% total weapon damage will go down by 50%. This will not affect newly spawned items. Please reroll or refind the item.
